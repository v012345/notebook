### [tools:node="remove"](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/manage-manifests)
Remove this element from the merged manifest. Although it seems like you should instead just delete this element, using this is necessary when you discover an element in your merged manifest that you don't need, and it was provided by a lower-priority manifest file that's out of your control (such as an imported library).

At the end of this chapter, you should understand why Git is around, and why you should use it and you should be all set up to do so.  (在本章结束时，你应该了解 Git 为何存在，为什么要使用它，并且你应该做好一切准备。)
screw things up  (搞砸了)  (2)
Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover them.  (使用 VCS 通常还意味着，如果您搞砸了或丢失了文件，您可以轻松地恢复它们。)  
In addition, you get all this for very little **overhead**.  (此外，您只需很少的**开销**即可获得所有这些。)  
prone  (倾向于)  
This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error-prone.  (这种方法非常常见，因为它非常简单，但也非常容易出错。)  
setup  
to a certain degree  (在一定程度上)  
downside  
The most obvious is the single point of failure that the centralized server represents.  (这么做最显而易见的缺点是中央服务器的单点故障 / 最明显的是集中式服务器所代表的单点故障。)
corrupted  (损坏的)  
As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy.  (与生活中的许多伟大事物一样，Git 始于一些创造性的破坏和激烈的争议。)

This may not seem like a huge deal, but you may be surprised what a big difference it can make.  (这可能看起来没什么大不了的，但您可能会惊讶于它可以带来多大的改变。)  
integral  
undoable  
It is hard to get the system to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way.  (很难让系统执行任何不可撤销的操作或以任何方式擦除数据)  
severely  
parlance  
If you know how to run the command-line version, you can probably also figure out how to run the GUI version, while the opposite is not necessarily true.  (如果您知道如何运行命令行版本，您可能还可以弄清楚如何运行 GUI 版本，而相反则不一定。)  
Also, while your choice of graphical client is a matter of personal taste, all users will have the command-line tools installed and available.  (此外，虽然您选择图形客户端是个人喜好问题，但所有用户都将安装并使用命令行工具。)  
derivative  
Unsurprisingly, you need to be located somewhere in a Git repository for this option to work properly.  (
不出所料，您需要位于 Git 存储库中的某个位置才能使此选项正常工作)

bona fide  (善意的 , 真的)

Finally, the command tells you which branch you’re on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same branch on the server.  (最后，该命令会告诉您您在哪个分支上，并通知您它没有与服务器上的同一分支分道扬镳。)  
follow suit  (跟风)  
GitHub changed the default branch name from master to main in mid-2020, and other Git hosts followed suit.  (GitHub 在 2020 年年中将默认分支名称从 master 更改为 main，其他 Git 主机也纷纷效仿。)  
Let's say you add a new file to your project, a simple README file.  (假设您在项目中添加了一个新文件，一个简单的 README 文件。)

But it's a lot easier to make up imaginary Frequently Asked Questions than it is to discover the real ones.  (但是，编造虚构的常见问题要比发现真实的常见问题容易得多。)  
sustained  (adj 持续 经久)
No grand hypothesizing, no visionary pronouncements here—open eyes and accurate note-taking are what's needed most.  (这里没有宏大的假设，也没有有远见的声明——睁大眼睛和准确记笔记是最需要的。)  
Development is highly iterable, where you can start by forming a basic behaviour, then create new branches to deal with alternate methods of achieving goals, with branches ordered by their desirability, allowing for the AI to have fallback tactics should a particular behaviour fail. This is where they really shine.  (开发是高度可迭代的，您可以从形成基本行为开始，然后创建新的分支来处理实现目标的替代方法，分支按其可取性排序，允许人工智能在特定行为失败时采用后备策略。这是他们真正闪耀的地方。)  
It is quite how expressive these nodes can be, sometimes operating more as a standard library to manipulate data within the tree itself, than just simply character commands, that really make behaviour trees exciting to me.  (这些节点的表现力非常好，有时更像是一个标准库来操作树本身内的数据，而不仅仅是简单的字符命令，这真的让我兴奋不已)
